2.	Logic Task

The client has a search page with a search box for inputing search content and a body for displaying the result. The client wants the search function on the page to work like the description below:
â€¢	It should work like the smart search, that means the result will be shown while users are typing. The result should not be shown immediately, it should be shown after 3 seconds when users stop typing.
Your task is creating the search page, and you are not allowed to use any libraries or frameworks, only using native javascript. Your final result should include some files: index.html, main.js, data.json while index.html is used for displaying the search box and results, main.js is used for the logic search function, and data.json is used for mock data of the search result from an api. The style and mock data for the page are not important, so that it is up to you to choose.
